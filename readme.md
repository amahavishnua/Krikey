Docker-Google GCP (CRS)

First created image of the API after testing.
This Node build API gets data from AWS RDS (Postgres).

Then tested the image by running it on docker. Worked well.

Then pushed the image to container registry on GCP. Then used cloud run to deploy the image.
It is up and running.
